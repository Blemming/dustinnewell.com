                        My first job straight out of school. It's a little rough around the edges but it does what it is suposed to. 
                        My client wanted a portal with a few requirements; be able to post news on the home page, dynamic calendar of events,
                        a list of their members, a list of their employees and a way to manage all this content. I made a simple CMS with PHP and MySQL.
                        The front-end is basic HTML, CSS with a little JQuery. Sadly I had not learned about responsive web design yet, so the website is not
                        responsive. In retrospective, I find the design a bit dry. If I could start over, I would've chosen different colors, made better use of white spaces, wouldn't have made everything
                        so square, probably added more images, made the text smaller and make the website responsive. This project was a good learning experience,
                        I learned; how to communicate with a client who wasn't my teacher, a bit of Javascript and JQuery and that I still had a lot to learn about
                        web development.

                        Newly hired at Beaulieu Canada, I was thrown into a project which was already started. I helped by doing a lot of the basic tasks such as
                        integrating the content on the static pages. This is where I learned the basics of PCSoft's Web Dev, a wysiwyg IDE with a programming language
                        whose syntax is similar to Visual Basic. It is also a full stack solution with easy ways to connect to any type of database. I learned about
                        the office work flow and how to work on a project with someone else.

                        With a little more knowledge about PCSoft's Web Dev, I was tasked to integrate the US version of the website. Beaulieu Canada has an american sister company called
                        Beaulieu America. Being a sister company, they had different products, warranties and services. WebDev generates the website dynamically so integrating the american
                        version was tasked to me so I could understand on a deeper level the architecture of Beaulieu's information systems.
