                        My first job straight out of school. It's a little rough around the edges, but it does what it is supposed to. My client wanted
                        a portal with a few requirements; be able to post news on the home page, dynamic calendar of events,
                        a list of their members, a list of their employees and a way to manage all this content. I made a
                        simple CMS with PHP and MySQL. The front-end is basic HTML, CSS with a little JQuery. Sadly, I had
                        not learned about responsive web design yet, so the website is not responsive. In retrospect,
                        I find the design a bit dry. If I could start over, I would've chosen different colors, made better
                        use of white spaces, wouldn't have made everything so square, probably added more images, made the
                        text smaller and make the website responsive. This project was a good learning experience, I learned;
                        how to communicate with a client who wasn't my teacher, a bit of Javascript and JQuery and that I
                        still had a lot to learn about web development.

                        Newly hired at Beaulieu Canada, I was thrown into a project which was already started. I helped by doing a lot of the basic
                        tasks such as integrating the content on the static pages. This is where I learned the basics of
                        PCSoft's Web Dev, a WYSIWYG IDE with a programming language whose syntax is similar to Visual Basic.
                        It is also a full stack solution with easy ways to connect to any type of database. I learned about
                        the office workflow and how to work on a project with someone else.

                        I was given the task to build a static website for a Beaulieu cousin company. Because the website had to be responsive, I would not use PCSoft's Webdev. Given 
                        the scope of the project Webdev would have been overkill either way. I viewed this opportunity to brush up my classic front-end skills. I was provided with a wire frame
                        and content, the rest was up to me. I used the classic JQuery and a few simple javascript libraries for the parallax scrolling and sliders. Being a beginner developer 
                        I did not know about bootstrap or css frameworks, so the css is all handwritten. In retrospect, given the opportunity I would completely revamp the website. Parallax 
                        scrolling was a fad, scrolljacking is bad UX practice. Also, I do not like to use JQuery, I prefer to write my selectors myself. There is also a lot to be done about
                        the design; choice of fonts, choice of icons and layout all need work.

                        I was tasked to build a good looking web presentation that would be displayed over tablets for a flooring convention. I did a bit of research and decided that Reveal.js would 
                        would meet the requirements. I put together the content and modified some of the css to give it a better suited look, fitting Beaulieu's needs. I practiced some of my css skills 
                        and learned more about Javascript.

                        With a little more knowledge about PCSoft's Web Dev, I was tasked to integrate the US version of the website. Beaulieu Canada
                        has an American sister company called Beaulieu America. Being a sister company, they had different
                        products, warranties and services. WebDev generates the website dynamically so integrating the American
                        version was not a very difficult task. I was tasked this project so I could better understand the architecture of Beaulieu's information
                        systems. My experience with the WYSIWYG editor was not an enjoyable one. The Webdev editor makes menial tasks more complicated and removes
                        control from it's user. Webdev at the time also did not allow the possibility of a responsive website.

                      <p>
                        Faced with my frustrating experience with Webdev and Beaulieu's marketing desire for a responsive website I researched for a solution. Beaulieu did not have the 
                        resources to change the backend from Webdev. So I looked for a way to connect it's backend to a normal front-end. The solution I found was to create a simple RESTful API
                        with Webdev and query it with a normal front-end. Giving me full control of the front-end and saving the company the cost of extra pricy Webdev licenses. The only trouble was 
                        that Webdev at the time was not designed to build a RESTful API, so if this were to be a public facing API the security risks would be enormous. I decided to learn Node and Express
                        to build a proxy for the API. While learning Node and Express I fell in love with Javascript and finally decided to build the whole Beaulieu Flooring website with it. I used Express-Handlebars for the
                        server side templating and Vue (which I also fell in love with) for the simple client-side Javascript.

                        Beaulieu had hired a web designer. I worked with him to create the design for the new responsive website. Knowing that technology would no longer be holding us back,
                        we set our sights high. I used bootstrap to ease the building of the responsive website and font-awesome for the icons. The images and content was provided to me. The about 
                        section contained too much content for me to manage and develop at the same time so I installed an instance of <a href="https://getcockpit.com/">Cockpit CMS</a> and modified it's 
                        Javascript script to work directly into Node instead of directly on the client side. This way the marketing could easily change the highly changing specs and I could spend more time
                        developing the website. In retrospect, when I will have the time, I want to make the website more mobile-first, removing a lot of unnecessary UX components. I also want to use more Vue 
                        and webpack to prerender the website to enhance performance and SEO. I also in the near future, want to develop a more complete headless API to manage more of the content on all websites.
